# Fine-tuning pipeline
The IPython notebook named "" demonstrates the fine-tuning pipeline using the [medalpaca/medical_meadow_medqa](https://huggingface.co/datasets/medalpaca/medical_meadow_medqa) dataset processed to our needs.  As a base Model, we used the [Falcon-7b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/vilsonrodrigues/falcon-7b-instruct-sharded) Model.

For further explanation, take a look at the notebook.

The implementation is based on a Tutorial proposed by [AI Jason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9zv369Ggfk&t=1s)
